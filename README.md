Investigate the relationship between pricing, ratings, and delivery availability.

Identify top-rated and best-value restaurants.

Visualize patterns using bar plots, pie charts, box plots, and heatmaps.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

📁 Dataset Description
Zomato Restaurant Dataset: Contains restaurant-specific details like name, location, rating, average cost, cuisines, etc.

Country Code Dataset: Maps numeric codes to country names, enabling global-level comparison.

✅ Key Findings
India has the highest number of restaurant listings, with New Delhi alone accounting for ~68% of Indian entries.

North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food cuisines are the most popular.

Online delivery is common but not always linked to top-rated restaurants.

Some restaurants maintain perfect ratings (e.g., Naturals Ice Cream), while others show value-for-money by combining low cost with high ratings.

Weak correlation exists between number of votes and aggregate rating.
